  <p class="lead">Welcome!</p>

  <p><strong>ArticTools</strong> is a collection of free tools for use in speech therapy for articulation. You can use
    the links above to find lists of words for sounds you want to target. You can also find <a
        href="{{ url_for('pictograms') }}">pictograms</a> for words to create worksheets for home practice or to use in
    therapy without verbal modeling.</p>

  <p>A grid building tool is coming soon that will automate creation of those worksheets. Stay tuned!</p>
